Given the directed graph of train routes in the format "AB3 BC4 CD5 DE4 AE4", we are constructing a directed, weighted graph.

Map class implements a number of algorithms to aid with answering some questions about train routes.
Implemented algorithms include Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Breadth-first search.
